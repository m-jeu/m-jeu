### Welcome to my profile!

I'm an AI Student, with a love for all things AI, code, and people related.

I specifically have an interest in nature-inspired code and all things aerospace, though my courses and passion-projects usually take me through a wide variety of subjects that I might be working on.
My magnum opus, as much as I can call it that after being in this field for 1.5 years, is my [Orbital Transfer Pathfinder project](https://github.com/m-jeu/orbital-transfer-pathfinder). Though you could also find [data science projects](https://github.com/m-jeu/CM_0), or [more visualization oriented projects](https://github.com/m-jeu/s404-project) on my profile.
